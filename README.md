# table-web-scrapping

Data is generated in the table from the backend.
Firstly we are checking how many rows there are.
Then the function is taking each row-data, puts it into an object, and that object is stored in an array.
In the end, we receive the nest of objects, depending on the data, that we are receiving from the backend.
The final operation is to add all values in each column.
